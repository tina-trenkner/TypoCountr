# Typocountr - my first app!

Typocountr is my first app, a project created during my time as a student at Dev Academy, a JavaScript coding bootcamp in Auckland, NZ.

This is an app for readers, editors and news junkies. This allows readers to easily report the typos they find in any given article. (Full disclosure, the number of typos I've have made makes me cringe so hard.)

This app has the potential to be a full-stack app by submitting the story URL and number of typos to a database. 

Thanks to @ejhessing for his help on the tweet function and to @cooms for design help on the logo.
