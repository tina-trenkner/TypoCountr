# tina-trenkner-personal-project

My first personal app, a project created during my time at Dev Academy, a JavaScript coding bootcamp in Auckland, NZ.

This is an app for readers who find typos in the stories they read online. Bother journalists and readers miss copy editors.

Thanks to @ejhessing for his help on the tweet function and to @cooms for design help on the logo.
